🖥️ Project Title: Deadlock Detection Using Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)
📘 Project Description:
This project implements a Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) to simulate and analyze how an operating system handles resource allocation among processes. RAG is a graphical representation used to detect potential deadlocks in a system where multiple processes compete for limited resources.

The core objective of the project is to visualize the dynamic behavior of process-resource interactions and use graph-based algorithms to detect whether a deadlock situation may occur or is already present.

🎯 Key Features:
🔄 Dynamic Graph Construction: Allows users to create and modify processes and resource nodes dynamically.

🔗 Request & Allocation Edges: Simulates real-time request and allocation scenarios.

❌ Deadlock Detection: Implements cycle detection in the RAG to identify deadlocks.

📊 Visualization: Provides a clear, graphical view of the system state (using tools like NetworkX + Matplotlib in Python, or Java GUI).

🧠 Safe/Unsafe State Analysis: Differentiates between safe and unsafe states based on the current allocation.

🧱 Tools & Technologies:
Programming Language: Python / Java / C++

Libraries (Python): NetworkX, Matplotlib, Tkinter or PyQt for GUI

Concepts Used: Graph Theory, Deadlock Detection, OS Resource Management

✅ Learning Outcomes:
Understanding of deadlock and resource allocation in operating systems.

Ability to apply graph algorithms (e.g., cycle detection) in real-world scenarios.

Experience in system simulation and UI development for technical tools.
